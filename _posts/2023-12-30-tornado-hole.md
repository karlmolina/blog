At [karlmolina.com](https://karlmolina.com), I have a couple of p5.js sketches that I've made. I also have included a pixi.js doodle. Maybe I should call them skdoodle or intskdoodle for interactive sketch doodle. Tornado hole is a fun interactive program that let's you drag around a sheet of dots and make ripples.

This is probably one of my favorite sketches that I've made. I originally made it with p5.js but that was too slow. I changed it to use pixi.js which uses WebGL, and it's much faster.

It's called tornado hole because if I change how the dots are connected it turns into a sock looking thing.

In the future I want to add configuration to all my sketches so that you can change the parameters and see how it affects the sketch. That way you can see the actual tornado hole, and it's not just a sheet.

### Some more things I want to add with this sketch:
- Make the dots arranged in a hexagon pattern like a honey comb. Changing how they are organized changes how the ripples look.
- If you have a multi-touch device, you can drag with multiple fingers and make multiple ripples at once.
